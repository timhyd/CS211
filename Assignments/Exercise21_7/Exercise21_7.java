/*
(Revise Listing 21.9, CountOccurrenceOfWords.java) Rewrite Listing 21.9 to
display the words in ascending order of occurrence counts.
(Hint: Create a class named WordOccurrence that implements the Comparable
interface. The class contains two fields, word and count. The compareTo
method compares the counts. For each pair in the hash set in Listing 21.9, create
an instance of WordOccurrence and store it in an array list. Sort the array list
using the Collections.sort method. What would be wrong if you stored the
instances of WordOccurrence in a tree set?)
